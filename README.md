# Monad for dummies

If like me you think monad is a pain in the a** to understand, you
would like to understand it with code rather than for ever
explanations.

* **Explore:** We will explore monad in different languages.

* **Create:** We will create our own monad and you will see that it's nothing more than a wrapper...
